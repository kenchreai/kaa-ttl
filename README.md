# kaa-ttl
An RDF Turtle file of all public data in the Kenchreai Archaeological Archive.

One qualificatioin: kaa.trig is a http://www.w3.org/TR/trig/ file.

Another thing to keep in mind: While many of the identifiers used here are stabe, some will change. The ontology, however, is very much under development. As such it is currenlty idiosyncratic and designed express the data as it currently exists in archival paper records or is being generated by current work. KAA will eventually be serialized according to existing standards for sharing archaeological data as those come to be widely used and further developed.
